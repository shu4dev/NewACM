## Who are we?

We, the **Association for Computing Machinery at UH Manoa (ACManoa/ACM)**, are the largest computer science student organization at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

We are a registered student chapter of the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/) as well as a recognized student-chartered registered independent organization (RIO) at the [University of Hawaii at Manoa](https://www.hawaii.edu/). We welcome students of all different backgrounds, interests, and skill levels to join our community and share our passion for computer science.

## How is ACManoa structured?

ACManoa is split into different interest-focused sub-groups called **special interest groups (SIGs)**. Despite the SIGs independently planning events towards their own individual interests and goals, our events are always and will always be open to everyone -- not just SIG members.

## What are the goals of ACManoa?

ACManoa has three goals -- to provide _social_, _professional_, and _technical_ enrichment for our members. We provide events of all three kinds to meet our three goals.

- We hold social events for our members to develop and strengthen their interpersonal relationships as well as to have fun.
- We hold professional development events to connect our members to professionals in the industry within the local community as well as abroad
- We also hold technical workshops and other types of technical enrichment events.

**Want to see a new SIG focused on something you want?** Members in ACManoa are encouraged create Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and collaborate on their own events and projects. Contact <acmmanoa@hawaii.edu> if you want to get started!

## Where are we located?

Our clubroom, **ICSpace**, is located on the third floor of the Pacific Ocean Science & Technology (POST) building in room POST 318B. We have monitors, whiteboards, a microwave, and refrigerators for club members to use. We are continuously looking for new ways to improve our room, so if you have a suggestion as to how, please contact us <acmmanoa@hawaii.edu>.
